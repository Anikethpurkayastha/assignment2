# assignment2

This project includes two basic Python programs. The first program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is odd or even. It does this by using the modulus operator (%) to determine if the number is divisible by 2. If the remainder is zero, the number is classified as even; otherwise, it is odd. The second program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. It initializes a variable to store the running total and adds each number from the range to this variable. Once the loop completes, it displays the final sum as output.
